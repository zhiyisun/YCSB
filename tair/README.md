## Quick Start

This section describes how to run YCSB on Tair. 
This folder is ported from http://github.com/sel-fish/YCSB.git

### 1. Start Tair

### 2. Install Java and Maven

### 3. Set Up YCSB

Git clone YCSB and compile:

    git clone http://github.com/zhiyisun/YCSB.git
    cd YCSB
    mvn -pl com.yahoo.ycsb:tair-binding -am clean package

### 4. Provide Tair Connection Parameters
    
Set the host, port, and password (do not tair auth is not turned on) in the 
workload you plan to run.

- `tair.mastercs`
- `tair.slavecs`
- `tair.groupname`

Or, you can set configs with the shell command, EG:

    ./bin/ycsb load tair -s -P workloads/workloada -p "tair.mastercs=127.0.0.1:5198" -p "tair.groupname=group_1" > outputLoad.txt

### 5. Load data and run tests

Load the data:

    ./bin/ycsb load tair -s -P workloads/workloada > outputLoad.txt

Run the workload test:

    ./bin/ycsb run tair -s -P workloads/workloada > outputRun.txt
